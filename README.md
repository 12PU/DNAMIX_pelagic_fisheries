# DNAMIX_pelagic_fisheries
Using eDNA to estimate biomass of bycatch in pelagic fisheries
The repository contains 3 raw data files: 
1. the "experimental_data.RData" that is data from the experimental approach needed for setting up model 1
2. the "raw_genetic_data_landings.RData" that are the eDNA measurments (percentages) that are converted into biomass following model 1.
The percentages are then changed to fractions to be used for plotting and model 2. 
3. the "modeling_2_data.RData" that is the data used in modeling 2. Here the data needed to be modified and contains only 2 out of 4 types
type = 1 refferes to the eDNA at the ship, and  type = 2 refferes to the eDNA at the factory biomass values. 
Bucket estimates and log book information can not be made publically available.
